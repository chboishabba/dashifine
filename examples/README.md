# Examples directory

This folder is a convenient, version-controlled location for storing artefacts.

## Populating the folder

* **Full pipeline** – copy the PNGs and `summary.json` produced by `python demo.py`
  from `/mnt/data` into this directory if you want to keep or share them.  The
  script emits the coarse density map, the refined origin slice, and ten rotated
  slices.
* **Package smoke test** – run
  `python dashifine/Main_with_rotation.py --output_dir examples` to place the
  zero-filled placeholder images generated by the importable package here.  This
  is the command exercised by the CI instructions in `AGENTS.md`.

## Requirements

Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt` (NumPy, Matplotlib,
SciPy, and Pytest) before running either entry point.
